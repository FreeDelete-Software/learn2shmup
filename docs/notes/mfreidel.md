### Scope changes

While considering how to compartmentalize everything, the concept of a modding
system began to be considered. This would make the process of developing a game
feel more like making many small mods that all fit together. This mod-centric
approach could also be used by others outside of the core dev team to learn
Godot and contribute to the game. Seems like a pretty good fit for the project,
although makes it slightly more complex in some ways.

**Status:**
Team has their environments mostly set up with git.

### More planning is needed

First and foremost, there needs to be a larger overall structure to the project. Before starting, I planned the first three sessions to get everyone ready to code together. Beyond that, I haven't planned anything relating to the code. **Really** need to figure that stuff out.

### Unit Testing with GUT?

Unit tests in Godot are new to me. I can explain TDD, but can't speak much about applying it in Godot. Some research led me to [GUT](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut), which seems to be a good option. Not sure if it would be best to skip TDD for the project, since I don't know what I'm doing with GUT. Introducing TDD to the team might also be too much information for newer developers. If manual testing becomes a huge pain, then we can look into this later.

### Next steps

1. Group Learning
   - agile development, kanban, and sprints
   - planning and documenting
   - communication and coordination
   - First contributions
2. Individual Learning
   - Godot fundamentals and its documentation
   - GIMP (or Photoshop) for 2D game art
   - Guided practice
3. Start first (second?) sprint
