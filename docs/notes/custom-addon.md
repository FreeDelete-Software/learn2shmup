# Custom addon

The custom addon for learn2shmup will provide a framework of Nodes that are
designed to operate together as the foundational components of a shmup-style
game. Each custom Node will have special functions which create baseline
functionality that can easily be expanded on.

This addon can theoretically be used to make a game from scratch outside of
the project. However, in these early stages of development, it will be developed
as a part of learn2shmup. Once everything is in a more refined and stable state,
this addon may be moved to its own repo and published on Godot's asset library.
